# How to create a non-printable brick 


<p>This example illustrates how to create a brick that is visible on the screen, but not printed.</p><p>All bricks created by the XtraPrinting Library can be printed. Occasionally you have to create bricks used for navigation purposes only. Although these bricks are displayed on screen, they should be excluded from the printout. This can be easily accomplished via the <strong>Brick.Printed</strong> property.</p>
